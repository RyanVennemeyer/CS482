# NLP-Project
Natural Language Processing for Kaggle Project

What is the problem that you will be investigating?
why is it interesting?
  The problem our team will be investigating is natural language processing and the comparison between two sentences, do these sentences relate to one another?     Contradict one another? Or have no relations whatsoever? Our job is to evaluate sentence A and B with values 0,1,2 based on the comparison between the two statements. This is interesting because it is the starting point of learning speech recognition and voice analytics.
