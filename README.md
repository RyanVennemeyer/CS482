Natural Language Processing for Kaggle Project

What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?

The problem our team will be investigating is natural language processing and the comparison between two sentences, do these sentences relate to one another?     Contradict one another? Or have no relations whatsoever? Our job is to evaluate sentence A and B with values 0,1,2 based on the comparison between the two statements. This is interesting because it is the starting point of learning speech recognition and voice analytics.

What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?

The data that we are going to be using is the given and if we find that this is not enough we are going to create our own

What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You donâ€™t have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.

How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

The way we are going to evaluate our results is by giving a dataset and depending on how accurate it is will depend on how high the percentage will be given.

There is an existing method shown in a demo, using the keras library. The approach taken is to use a recurrent neural network solution, to the binary classification problem presented.

Since we are beginners in this type of problem, we will go through the tutorial for the simple recurrent neural network, and then we will attempt to implement a gated recurrent unit. We can use gradient boosting (XGBoost) to improve accuracy. There is simplified data and more comprehensive data provided by the tutorial as well which we will be using to evaluate our results.
